Creating a Website for Software Design 4 Project

Will update the read me file as the website is developed to summarize what the website does.
Understandability:
__________________
What the software does and it's purpose:
_______________________________________________________________________________
The main purpose of the website is to allow people to store and retrieve files. 
This will be deployed in the form of a website to allow users to easily access the files
through a webbrowser. The website can be deployed either be deployed on a local network (intranet)
or on the internet. If it's deployed over the internet a fixed IP address that is usable on 
the internet would need to be obtained or provided by a third party as a service. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The intended market and users of the software:
______________________________________________
The indented use of the software is for personal file storage of users. It's not meant for commercial use 
it's a private storage for registered users. If it were to be used commercially then it would need to be 
deployed on scalable virtual servers capable of handling a large user amount.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The softwares basic functions:
________________________________________________________________________________
The basic functions of the software will be divided up into three modules:
*A user interface used to log in to an account and then display the user's files.
*A database component used to authenticate the user and keep records of the 
	file relationships (keep record of files related to a specific user).
*A module used to handle the storage. The module must communicate with the database 
	to know which files the user is allowed to access.

When users log in they are not supposed to be aware of other users. Other users must be transparent as 
well as the files of the other users.
Thus to the user it must seem as if they are the only one using the service. This is to keep a measure of 
security.
Thus a user will only be able to see their files and only their files when they are logged in to 
their account.
