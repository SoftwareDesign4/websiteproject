#Hunting South Africa - A Safari Hunting Experience  

##Introduction  

When writing software that other people will use and other engineers will change then you usually have to provide additional information as well as the code of the program. You need to concern yourself with writing program guidelines, and documenting the program etc.  

The fundamental activities of software engineering are:  
1.	 Software Specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints of its operation.  
2.	Software Development, where customers and engineers define.  
3.	Software Validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.  
4.	Software Evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.  

Software engineering has a broad range of approaches to realising the production of software.  Determining which methods and techniques to use is seeded in the type of application that is being developed. Generally, application types are grouped into several categories, namely stand-alone applications, interactive transaction-based applications, embedded control systems, batch processing systems, entertainment systems, systems for modelling and simulation, data collection systems, and systems-of-systems.

##Our software engineering project is an interactive web-based application  

Developing this application much prefers iterative development and delivery. The web-application system also much prefers being composed of reusable components.  

Regardless of application type, the following software engineering fundamentals apply to all types of software systems:  

1.	They should be developed using a managed and understood software development process. The organization developing the software should plan the development process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when it will be completed. Of course, different processes are used for different types of software.  

2.	 Dependability, security and performance are important for all types of systems. Software should behave as expected, without failures and should be available for use when it is required. It should be safe in its operation and, as far as possible, should be secure against external attack. The system should perform efficiently and should not waste resources.  

3.	Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) document is important. You have to know what different customers and users of the system expect from it and you have to manage their expectations so that a useful system can be delivered within budget and to schedule.  

4.	 You should make as effective use as possible of existing resources. This means that, where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed rather than write new software.  

##Conclusion  

Software is not just about writing code, it includes having documentation which covers all aspects of a software development project; that is from inception to realisation and furthermore ongoing maintenance.
